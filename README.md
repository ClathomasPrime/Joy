# Joy
Interpreter for the concatenative language Joy

# Installation

* Install GHC (or another Haskell compiler I guess)
* Go to project root and enter `runhaskell Main.hs stdlib.joy` in your shell
  * This will get you into the Joy REPL
  * Try a function, for example, `4 fact` should get you `[Int 24]`, as defined in stdlib.joy.
